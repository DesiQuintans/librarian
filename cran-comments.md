## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I have:

    - Put the code for examples in comments so that running the examples would not 
      install packages unless the user explicitly removed the # tag.

## Test environments

- win-builder R-devel
- Local Windows 7 64-bit install, R-devel (2018-05-23 r74775)
- Local Windows 7 64-bit install, R 3.5.0
- Local Windows 7 64-bit install, R 3.4.2


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs for the 3 local R versions that I tested, 
including R-devel.

win-builder produced no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

win-builder produced 1 NOTE ("checking CRAN incoming feasibility").


## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
