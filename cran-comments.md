## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I have made these changes based on your feedback:

    - Improved terminology (packages, search paths, libraries, etc.)
    - Functions return a vector of success/failure for each package that was operated on.
    - Readme teaches the user how to specify a library location.
    - User can now set a CRAN mirror.


## Test environments

- win-builder R-devel
- win-builder R-current (3.5.0)
- Local Windows 7 64-bit install, R 3.5.0


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs for the local R version that I tested.

win-builder (R-devel and R 3.5.0) produced no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

win-builder produced 1 NOTE ("checking CRAN incoming feasibility").


## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
